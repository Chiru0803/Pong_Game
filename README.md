# Pong_Game
The Pong game is a classic two-player arcade game that simulates table tennis.
Players control paddles on either side of the screen and use them to hit a ball back and forth. 
The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to make the opponent miss the ball.

The game can be implemented using the Pygame library, which provides functionalities for game development in Python.
Pygame handles graphical rendering, user input, and game loop management.
